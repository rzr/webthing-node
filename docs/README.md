if you try to replicate it and stuck on missing instructions
I would appreciate that you file issues
or even better make pull request (just edit in github) that insert "TODO marks" in following chapters, like:

* TODO: please explain more this chapter and then remove this TODO line

Support is also possible, ask in:

* https://github.com/rzr/webthing-iotjs

## DEMO: ##

Recently I shared this short video about different webthings working along.

Many technologies were involved, among them webthing-iotjs (ARTIK's LED at end of video)

This Web of Thing demo "world first smart orchid ever" is not that new, I am sure
but I hope those hints will inspire you to create different projects, let it know.

## DISCLAIMER: ##

This guide will focus mostly on using iotjs to build webthings, but more hints are shared.

Instead of freezing "quick and dirty" demo code.
I preferred to split demo in several smaller independents parts and upstream the most I can
and then provide support on mainline branches.

Upstreaming can be a slow process,
so I will be also share some development branches,
but they are expected to move,
since I am continuously catching up upstream.


## INTRODUCTION: ##

Webthing-iotjs is a fork of webthing-node adapted for IoT.js runtime.

* https://github.com/mozilla-iot/webthing-node
* http://www.iotjs.net/

Although it is functional, it has some limitations that worth to be known:

* MDNS is not supported yet, so no auto discovery of devices so URL should be added from UI.
* Websockets are not implemented yet, while IoT.js recently introduced WS, it's not used yet.
* Actions and Events are also dropped as not critical.

It can run on many devices such as regular Linux system but maybe not your favorite MCU
other MCU/MPU target to consider is ARTIK05x, as shown at end of demo,
you could try to compare to Arduino, but I wouldn't dare.

ARTIK05x are running full featured OS, called Tizen:RT,
don't confuse with Linux Based Tizen, this one has a different kernel
and is targeting lower class architecture.

One key feature of Tizen:RT is "native javascript" support, using
JerryScript and IoT.js runtime.

Because IoT.js tries to align the most to nodejs's design and conventions
I was tempted to try to port the Mozilla's webthing-node SDK to
IoT.js and it worked !

Note that features were removed, a
nd the code has been downgraded to earlier ECMA standards,
since the code base was very small that task was done manually
to avoid generated overhead using transpiliers such as babel.


![ARTIK05x](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c3db9783f1c00fe24ac29d19d007b9b9c0bddb24/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f446a716f4a56415734414577354a342e6a7067)


## USAGE: ##

* Setup gateway as explained at: https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/
* Add thing URL adapter
* Deploy iotjs on supported devices
* Run webthing example on target device
* Add thing by URL from gateway's UI ($ip:$port conventionally 8888 if 80 not usable)

See next chapters for details.


### PREREQUISITE: SETUP MOZILLA IOT GATEWAY ###

Since Mozilla Gateway 0.5 has been just released,
so it should be easy to install on RaspberryPi.

* TODO: There is bug in current (or all previous) release 
  with several properties of same type,
  so the gateway should be rebuild until my patch is merged:

  * https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway/issues/1148
  * https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway/pull/1249
  * https://github.com/tizenteam/gateway

Once installed, you can check by installing "virtual-adapter" as explained before:

* https://s-opensource.org/2018/04/25/mozilla-iot-generic-sensors/

![virtual-things](https://s-opensource.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/virtual-things-1024x795.png)


#### MOZILLA IOT GATEWAY ON RASPBERRYPI (RASPBIAN): ####

Just install released image on RaspberryPi 2 or 3,


#### MOZILLA IOT GATEWAY ON GNU/LINUX: ####


* TODO: document


#### MOZILLA IOT GATEWAY ON DOCKER: ####

While developing I made my own docker file:

* [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile)

Usage is straightfoward, install docker and run from source


```bash
sudo=sudo # unless docker properly configured
project="webthing-node"
url="https://github.com/tizenteam/${project}"
branch="sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master"
git clone --recursive --depth 1 -b "$branch" "$url" ; cd "$project"
image="debian:latest"
sed -e "s|^FROM .*|FROM $image|g" -i Dockerfile
time $sudo docker-compose up
```

On benefit of having docker files in sources, 
is that project can be built on reference OS,
and be deployed on any as long as docker is supported.

For deeper integration, maybe you should try out 
upstream's docker images:

* https://hub.docker.com/r/mozillaiot/gateway/
* https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway-docker


* TODO: image is currently broken, I have upstreamed fixes
  * https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway-docker/pull/9


```shell
etcdir=/home/node/.mozilla-iot
datadir=/tmp/$etcdir
sudo docker run \
    -d \
    --rm \
    -v $datadir:$etcdir \
    --net=host \
    --name mozilla-iot-gateway \
    mozillaiot/gateway:arm
```

So rebuild from my branch:

```
sudo="sudo"
project="gateway-docker"
url="https://github.com/tizenteam/gateway-docker"
branch="master"
git clone --recursive --depth 1 -b "$branch" "$url" ; cd "$project"
time $sudo docker-compose up
```


* http://artik.local:8080
* TODO check and confirm it is working as explained


#### MOZILLA IOT GATEWAY ON ARTIK710 (TODO) ####

* TODO: This part is not ready consider to run on regular desktop or reference hardware (RasPi)

ARTIK 5,7 or even 10 should be able to support Mozilla-IoT's gateway
which was originally targeting RaspberryPi as reference platform and thus Raspbian OS.

My <a href='https://www.artik.io/modules/artik-710/'>ARTIK710</a> was shipped on Fedora-24 
(
<a href='https://s-opensource.org/2017/11/29/building-iotivity-arm-artik-devices/'>
the same OS I build IoTivity 1.3.1 package for
</a>
)

I have myself managed to make the gateway running ARTIK7 on fedora 24, with nvm node10
because node LTS failed to run, so I upgraded it and rebuild some adapters.

A couple of fixes were needed and are already upstreamed <a href='https://github.com/mozilla-iot/gateway/pull/1206'>hardcoded path or environment issues</a>, but didn't land in latest release 0.5.0.

Build step can be a bit intensive,
because some packages like sqlite3 
are only distributed as source 


* TODO: fix sqlite on node10
  * https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/994
  * https://github.com/TizenTeam/node-sqlite3
  * https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/issues/418
  * https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/pull/1028
  * https://dl.bintray.com/rzr/devel/
  
I think that latest ARTIK images switched to Ubuntu,
so I will be even easier to migrate from Raspbian as both are debian based.

* https://github.com/TizenTeam/gateway/tree/sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master

Optionally, If you have the interposer board you can also try out 
the generic sensor adapter ARM binaries should work too:

* https://s-opensource.org/2018/04/25/mozilla-iot-generic-sensors/

* TODO: build a docker image on device:

    timer $sudo docker build https://github.com/tizenteam/gateway-docker.git#master
    time $sudo docker-compose up
    + npm install yarn
    Illegal instruction (core dumped)


More info about this device:

* https://www.artik.io/


#### MOZILLA IOT ON OTHERS: ####

I can share more hints later, just ask, tell me more on your setup.


### USING IOTJS ON GNU/LINUX: ###

Only snapshot version if currently supported,
if using GNU/Linux rebuild it from scratch or install snapshot debian packages:


#### IOTJS ON DEBIAN: ####

Even if iotjs-1.0 landed in debian,
we'll use a snapshot version
(<a href='https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/pull/1400'>to enable all features in full profile</a>)

* https://packages.qa.debian.org/i/iotjs.html
* https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:rzrfreefr:snapshot/iotjs


#### IOTJS ON ARTIK710: ####

Several OS are supported on this device, mine was on Fedora-24, now support moved to Ubuntu,
some might also use Tizen too,
So for now we'll use Debian in a docker container mounted on external USB disk (4GB) and an other for swap

```shell
cat /etc/os-release # PRETTY_NAME="Fedora 24 (Twenty Four)"
sudo=sudo # Or configure your sudoers
$sudo sync

$sudo dnf install docker docker-compose screen time git etckeeper jq
screen # Press "Ctrl+a c" : to open a new terminal

$sudo systemctl stop docker
part="/dev/sda1" # TODO: updated if needed
mnt="/var/lib/docker"
$sudo mkfs.ext4 -L webthings "$part" # TODO: verify $part variable

$sudo mkdir -p "$mnt"
$sudo mount "$part" "$mnt"
swap=/dev/sdb1
$sudo mkswap $swap
$sudo swapon $swap
free
$sudo systemctl restart docker
$sudo docker version # docker-common-1.10.3-55.gite03ddb8.fc24.armv7hl
```

Then build container and start service (500 Mb will be used):

```bash
project="webthing-node"
url="https://github.com/tizenteam/${project}"
branch="sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master"
git clone --recursive --depth 1 -b "$branch" "$url" ; cd "$project"
image="arm32v7/debian"
sed -e "s|^FROM .*|FROM $image|g" -i Dockerfile
time sudo docker-compose up # 17min to build and run
```

Expected log:

```

#### WEBTHING-IOTJS ON RASPBIAN: ####

Just install IoT.js

* https://s-opensource.org/2018/03/13/using-iotjs-raspberrypi0/
* https://dl.bintray.com/rzr/raspbian-9-armhf/

See general instructions above.


#### WEBTHING-IOTJS ON DOCKER: ####

* https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/


#### WEBTHING-IOTJS ON INTEL EDISON: ###

Like previously explained on Edison, you can also try a blinky example on x86:

* https://s-opensource.org/2018/06/21/webthing-iotjs/

[![webthing-iotjs-20180621rzr](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/708774087.jpg?mw=960&mh=540)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/276279690#webthing-iotjs-20180621rzr "webthing-iotjs-20180621rzr")


### IOTJS ON TIZENRT: ###

IoT.js is part of Tizen:RT. Tizen:RT has good doucmentations on [How to use IoTjs](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT/blob/master/docs/HowToUseIoTjs.md) and [Build-for-ARTIK053-TizenRT](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/wiki/Build-for-ARTIK053-TizenRT).

To replicate WEBTHING-IOTJS ON ARTIK05X demo, please pull the code base at:

https://github.com/rzr/webthing-iotjs/

If you are interested in understanding more TizenRT in the context of this demo, the following links might be useful -

* https://www.slideshare.net/SamsungOSG/tizen-rt-a-lightweight-rtos-platform-for-lowend-iot-devices
* https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/tizen_rt/
* https://source.tizen.org/documentation/tizen-rt/tizen-rt-long-term-goals


#### WEBTHING-IOTJS ON ARTIK05X: ###

I made some script helpers to rebuild it all with a single make command,
this work is still in progress.

```shell
project="tizenrt"
url="https://github.com/tizenteam/tizenrt"
branch="sandbox/rzr/devel/webthing/master"
git clone --recursive --depth 1 -b "$branch" "$url" ; cd "$project"
make menuconfig # Configure WiFi to connect your hotspot (HowToUseIoTjs.md)
make demo # Add tty=/dev/ttyUSB1 # Add this if not detected properly
```

It was tested on ARTIK055s but should be also working on ARTIK053 or ARTIK053s,
just override machine variable in any make calls 

ie:

    make demo machine=artik053

More info about thoses devices:

* https://www.artik.io/


### USING NODEJS: ###

For debugging purposes, code is also compatible with nodejs but with stubbed IO functions,
in longer term I plan to align iotjs API for IO modules for node.

* TODO: upstream into webthing-node (reusable part)
* https://github.com/TizenTeam/GpiO


### EXTRA: USING SENSORS AND ACTUATORS: ###

Note: It's possible to use I2C sensors on IoT.js but since some sensors changes are not yet upstreamed,
this chapter will explain using node.

"Smart Orchid Demo" showed a clapsensor, which is basically just a GPIO input of KY-037's digital pin

* https://github.com/TizenTeam/webthing-node/blob/sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master/example/toggle-gpio-binary-sensor-thing.js

I used it on a Raspberry Pi using node, but it should work on any other device.


Demo also feature some I2C sensors, they were using nodejs runtime:

Check supported sensors in this high level wrapper to drivers:

* https://github.com/rzr/generic-sensors-lite

For now I recommend to use either BH1650 or BMP082 modules,
community implemented drivers,
which are supported by NPM community,
since my fixes were upstreamed.

[![mozilla-iot-gateway-sensors-20180406rzr.webm](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/693119286.jpg)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/263556462#mozilla-iot-gateway-sensors-20180406rzr "Video Demo")

For the record I used this PiHat, and modified it to plug additional sensor in (clap):

* https://www.tindie.com/products/anavi/anavi-flex-raspberry-pi-hat-for-iot/
* https://github.com/AnaviTechnology/anavi-flex/issues/1#issuecomment-274616910

Note that "generic-sensor-lite" module can be also used on gateway using this adapter already released since mozilla-iot-gateway-0.4:

* https://github.com/rzr/mozilla-iot-generic-sensors-adapter/
* https://github.com/TizenTeam/addon-list

### EXTRA: ARDUINO AND ESP: ###

Developing webthing on Arduino APIs or compatible platforms
such as Espressif ESP8266 or ESP32

Once your have setup build tool,
Developing is pretty straight forward, and it has been covered earlier:

* https://s-opensource.org/2018/06/21/webthing-iotjs/
* https://github.com/mozilla-iot/webthing-arduino

"Smart Orchid Demo" showed a light controller and arduino moisture sensor:

The RGB Lamp code is upstreamed at:

* https://github.com/mozilla-iot/webthing-arduino/tree/master/examples/RGBLamp

Since I shared a slightly more advanced example that handle ADC port,
it was used to monitor the moisture of the ground of a plant.

* https://github.com/mozilla-iot/webthing-arduino/tree/master/examples/LevelSensor

Hardware side, I used an Arduino mega with Ethernet Shield
(<a href='https://www.slideshare.net/SamsungOSG/iotivity-tutorial-prototyping-iot-devices-on-gnulinux/41'>same one in this IoTivity 1.2 "arduino switch" demo</a>)

A moisture sensor is just plugged on analog pin (and +5v GND, the digital pin was not used here, but it can be used for other boards without analog like RaspberryPi and use potentiometer as "hardware threshold").

* TODO: refactor to handle Arduino's WiFi shield too

* TODO: port iotjs to arduino and compare perfs

For reference code was developed in this repo: (but most of it is upstreamed)

* https://github.com/TizenTeam/webthing-esp8266

[![webthing-esp8266-webapp-20180602rzr](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/704744529.jpg)](https://www.slideshare.net/SamsungOSG/the-complex-iot-equation-and-floss-solutions-101449596/10 "Demo video")


### EXTRA: ACTIVITY PUB: ###

For the "Smart Orchid" notification service, it's relying on W3C Activity Pub and Mastodon FLOSS.

To try IoT.js, I made a simple command line client to the mastodon network, it's also compatible with node,
check related infos to use and setup account:

* https://github.com/rzr/mastodon-lite
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/mastodon-lite

Then I implemented a thing (works with node or iotjs):

* https://github.com/TizenTeam/webthing-node/blob/sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master/example/actuator-mastodon.js
* https://github.com/TizenTeam/webthing-node/blob/sandbox/rzr/devel/artik/master/example/mastodon-thing.js


Note, If you want to use earlier GNU social instance
it should work same or be easy to adapt.

* TODO: Create adapter for gateway


### EXTRA: WEBTHINGS-WEBAPP: ###

For front end developers, can also try this webapp 
originally designed as Tizen app (wgt)
* https://s-opensource.org/2018/06/21/webthing-iotjs/

It was tested on Tizen:5 on TM1,
WiFi needs to be enabled again, 
it's not trivial but I shared some hints on Tizen's wiki:

* https://wiki.tizen.org/TM1#tizen-5

Some patches are still under review:

* https://review.tizen.org/gerrit/#/c/181349/

Earlier Tizen's version might not work because mozilla's gateway UI
is expecting recent browsers.

* https://bugs.tizen.org/browse/TRE-1963

Then the application was then "ported" to Android
for Samsung Internet browser, just open those links:

* https://tizenteam.github.io/
* https://tizenteam.github.io/webthings-webapp/

Since PWA was supported in Tizen, so
I should worth a try on updated version.

Used repository:
* https://github.com/rzr/webthings-webapp
* https://github.com/tizenteam/webthings-webapp
